## Video Topics

Some highlights from the [Learn Phoenix Socket video](https://www.learnphoenix.tv/episodes/sockets). There are some useful examples there that I might want to come back to.

- Authorizing WS connections with valid user credentials
- Identifying connections uniquely (e.g., so the server can disconnect all WS sessions after a user changes their password)
- JS client examples â€” can just refer to the [docs](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/js/) instead

## Phoenix Sockets

- Endpoint configuration
- Transports
- Connecting

With HTTP, a server can send data to the client only when the client asks. Over WebSockets, a server can send data whenever it wants.

## Long Polling

Before WebSockets, used long polling for real-time behaviour. Downsides:

- Overhead: HTTP renegotiation for each request
  - _WebSocket connection only needs to be established once_
- Perceived latency: Delays before fresh data can be loaded
  - _Can send data over WebSockets in real-time w/o polling_

Phoenix has supported 2+ million WebSocket connections on a single server.
