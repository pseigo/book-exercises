No. On the second line of the comment, there is an ending delimiter \* which causes the comment to
close before the second ending delimiter.

Therefore, the compiler sees this as a complete comment:

    /* This is a comment that extends over several lines
        because it uses /* and */

And this as invalid code:

    as its starting and ending delimiters */
