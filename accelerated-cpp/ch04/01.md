*We noted in ยง4.2.3/65 that it is essential that the argument types in a call to max match exactly. Will the following code work? If there is a problem, how would you fix it?*

```c++
int maxlen;
Student_info s;
max(s.name.size(), maxlen);
```

Solution:
```c++
string::size_type maxlen = 0;
Student_info s;
max(s.name.size(), maxlen);
```

The arguments of `max` must be the same type. `s.name.size()` returns a number with type string::size_type, therefore we must make `maxlen` the same type.

`maxlen` must also be initialized with a value, in this case 0. Basic types are not initialized by default so we would be comparing `s.name.size()` to a garbage value.

`s` is a library type and will be initialized as empty, which will return 0 when asking for the size. Therefore this isn't a problem we need to worry about.
