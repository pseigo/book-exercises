*If the following code is legal, what can we infer about the return type of f?*

```c++
double d = f()[n];
```

`f`'s return type is `vector<double>`.

We are accessing an element from `f` at index `n`, and assigning this value to a `double`. Because the code is assumed to be legal, the return type of `f` must be a `double`.
