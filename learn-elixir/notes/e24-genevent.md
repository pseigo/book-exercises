# Episode 24: GenEvent

## Deprecation

> **[GenEvent behaviour](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenEvent.html#content)**
>
>  This behaviour is deprecated. Use Erlang/OTP's :gen_event module instead.
> 
> A event manager with event handlers behaviour.
> 
> If you are interested in implementing an event manager, please read the "Alternatives" section below. If you have to implement an event handler to integrate with an existing system, such as Elixir's Logger, please use :gen_event instead.
