# Episode 16: Applications

## OTP Applications

- A component implementing some distinct functionality
  - _Distinct parts of an app can be separated into their own apps_
- Can be started and stopped as a unit
  - _Complicated OTP apps have a root supervisor_
- Can be re-used in other systems

OTP is "buzzword compliant" because it

- Encourages isolated components
- Allows these components to run on separate hardware
- Solves the microservice communication problem
