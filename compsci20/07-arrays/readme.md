# Instructions
This assignment is a four-part series.

## Part One
Write a menu driven UI (User Interface) program that instantiates an array of 100 integers. Then write the following algorithms and associated menu items:

0. Exit the program.
1. Populate the array randomly.
2. Populate the array sequentially from 1 to 100.
3. Display the Array.
4. Shuffle the Array.

## Part Two
Continuing with your menu driven UI, add the following algorithm options:

1. A FIND algorithm that will find a number in the list and tell you where the first occurrence is. This will respond with a `-1` if the item is not in the list.
2. An algorithm that checks to see if the list is in ascending order.
3. An algorithm that continuously shuffles the list until it is in ascending order (or 100000 attempts; whichever comes first).

## Part Three
Continuing with your menu driven UI, add the following algorithm options:

1. An algorithm that scans the list and prints the lowest value from the list to the screen.
2. An algorithm that scans the list and prints the highest value from the list to the screen.
3. An algorithm that prompts the user for a number and then finds how many occurrences of that number occur in the list.
4. An algorithm that prompts the user for two numbers. The algorithm then will find all instances of the first number and replace them with the second number.
5. An algorithm that finds the section of the array with 10 consecutive indexes (addresses) that has the greatest sum.

## Part Four
Rewrite your arrays practice program from Assignments 1-3 so that instead of running sequentially, the program now uses method calls to run the program. The main program should instantiate the array but all other tasks should be handled by passing the array to a method to be completed.

*NOTE: I did this step first.*
