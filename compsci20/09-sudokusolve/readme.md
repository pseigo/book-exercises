# Instructions
In this project we are going to build a simple Sudoku solving program. Because this is a complicated process, we are going to build this in stages and explore different algorithms that will help us along the way.

## Part 1:
**Preparation:**
Design an algorithm that instantiates an array of 9 elements. This array is then populated sequentially with the numbers from 1 to 9. The array is then shuffled so that the numbers are out of order but only appear once in the list. Remove one number randomly from the list by changing it to zero.

**Algorithm 1:**
Write a method that scans the list of numbers and returns the number that has been removed from the list.

**Algorithm 2:**
Have the original program remove more than one number from the list. Write a method that scans the list of numbers and outputs the numbers that were removed from the list to the screen. There could be any amount of numbers missing from 1 to 9.

## Part 2:
**Preparation:**
Design an algorithm that instantiates a 3x3 array (9 elements). The array is then populated in a manner similar to the one above so that the numbers from 1 to 9 only appear once in the grid but are out of order. Remove one number randomly from the grid changing it to zero.

**Algorithm 1:**
Write a method that scans the grid of numbers and returns the number that has been removed from the list.

**Algorithm 2:**
Have the original program remove more than one number from the grid. Write a method that scans the grid of numbers and outputs the numbers that were removed from the grid to the screen. There could be any amount of numbers missing from 1 to 9.
