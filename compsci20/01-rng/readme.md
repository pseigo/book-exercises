**Assignment 2: Exploring the Random Number Generator**
Write a program that outputs random numbers within any given range. You should try to understand how the random number generator works by exploring questions such as:
1. Does it work for negative values?
2. Does it work if only one value is
negative?
3. Does it generate values at the limit boundaries? (i.e. if generating from `min = 1` and `max = 10`, does it generate 1’s and 10’s?).
4. What happens if you mix up the min and max values?
