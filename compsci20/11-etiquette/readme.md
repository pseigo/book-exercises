# Instructions
Many people do not know this, but when a person rides a bus, they shouldn't just choose a seat at random. Instead they should follow the rules of etiquette that promote comfort and cleanliness for all involved.

Now, the rules of transit etiquette are quite simple â€” always choose the seat that is furthest away from the most people and (in the case of a tie) closest to the ends. That's it.

Please make a program that will ask the user to tell you how many seats are in the row. Then the program will ask you if each one is occupied or unoccupied. After doing this, the program will tell you which one you should go to if you want to be polite.

# Sample
```
How many seats are in the row?
> 5

Is seat 1 free? (Y/N)?
> n

Is seat 2 free? (Y/N)?
> y

Is seat 3 free? (Y/N)?
> y

Is seat 4 free? (Y/N)?
> n

Is seat 5 free? (Y/N)?
> y

        ^
You should use seat 5!
