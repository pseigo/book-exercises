# Instructions
Error Trapping in JAVA is used to prevent the user from causing the program to malfunction (run time error) by limiting the types of input that they can enter. This can be either the type of input or the range of input.  The error trap algorithm works by using the TRY-CATCH commands to try to get input from the user and catching any errors that are generated.
