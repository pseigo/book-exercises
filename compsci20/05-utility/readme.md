# Notes
My first project using Eclipse, first experience with tests! Previous projects were written in Atom and compiled in MinGW.

# Instructions
Write a new class called **Utility**. This will be a class where you store useful methods that can be used across different programs. The methods in this class should be static.  Populate this class with several useful methods such as:

- Two overloaded `errorTrap` methods - one each for integers and doubles.
- A random number generator that takes minimum and maximum range values as parameters in any order.
- A `digitAt(int number, int n)` method that returns the n digit of number.
- A `getChar()` method that gets a char from the user and return it.

Build another program that tests the functionality of this class.
