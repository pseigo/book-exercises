# Lecture 34

## Clicker questions

- x

## Exam

- Final will be heavy on modules 10-12 and you need to be good at module 6 to do these.
- Hint: Final might have a HtDF problem at a level of complexity such that you NEED to write examples for accumulators. (multiple accumulators?)

## Mutation

Template for `for-each`:

```scheme
(@template for-each)
(define (fn lox)
  ;; acc: <Type>, <invariant>

  (local [(define acc...)]
    (begin (for-each ... lox) ; Î» expression or local fn
           (... acc))))
```


Summing elements in a list:

```scheme
;; Pure Tail Recursion
(@template (listof Number) accumulator)
(define (sum lon0)
  ;; acc is Number: sum of numbers in lon0 seen so far

  (local [(define (sum lon acc)
            (cond [(empty? lon0) acc]
                  [else
                   (sum (rest lon0) (+ (first lon0)
                                       lon0))]))]
    (sum lon0 0)))

;; With for-each
(@template for-each)
(define (sum lon)
  ;; acc: Natural; sum of numbers in lon0 seen so far

  (local [(define acc 0)]
    (begin (for-each (lambda (n)
                       (set! acc (+ n acc)))
                     lon)
           acc)))
```
