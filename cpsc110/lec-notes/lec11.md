# Lecture 11

## Clicker questions

- It is important that do you NOT change a template!
  - First clicker question showed that instead of putting an if statement in a recursive function's `else` clause, they (incorrectly) added a third `cond` case.
  - However, you CAN add cond cases for Large Enumerations like `on-key`. This is the only exception.

## Class topic

Today we worked a lot on lists, compound data, and started a HtDW program using compound data and lists.

See my notes for m4a and the lecture files in lectures/lec11!
