# Lecture 23

## Built-in abstract functions

Think about the relationhip between a function's combination, base case, and operation on the first (and eventually, every other) item. This is the key for translating between our old ListOf functions and `foldr`.

There is a [older] video on this on edX where Gregor goes over this model.

See my notes on `m8-abstraction`.
