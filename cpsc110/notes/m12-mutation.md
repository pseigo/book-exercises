# Module 12: Mutation

## Learning goals

- Explain the difference between non-mutable and mutable variables.
- Hand step the execution of functions operating on mutable variables.
- Design loops using ASL loop constructs similar to those found in languages like Java, Python, C, etc.
- Explain the interaction between using mutable state and using parallel computation to speed up large computations.

## Motivation and Considerations

**Mutable variables**: Variables that can change their value after they are
defined.

This mechanism is fundamental in almost any other language you
program in.

 - Despite being fundamental, it is surprisingly complex
 - Overuse of it leads to programs that are not amenable
   to parallelization (running on multiple processors).
   Since multi-core computers are now common, the ability
   to use mutation only when needed is becoming more and
   more important
 - Overuse of mutation can also make it difficult to
   understand programs, and difficult to test them well
