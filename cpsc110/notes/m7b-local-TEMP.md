# Module x: Title

## Learning goals

THIS IS A TEMPORARY FILE

## Notes

With regards to effiency, it is easy for programmers to worry

- too much,
- too soon, or
- or incorrectly

Better to design a simple program that's easy to understand and change. Worry about efficiency later.

Refactoring where a value is used twice:

1. Find nearest enclosing expression containing the multiple computations
2. Wrap in local
3. Define computation as a constant in `[]`
4. Rename occurences of computation to the local constant

## Terminology
