Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.

```c++
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
          << " and " << v2;
          << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
```

If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How would you fix it?

## Solution

The program is NOT legal. The first output operators, `<<`, on lines 2 and 3 require left-hand operands, which they do not have. This is because the previous statements were ended with a semicolon.

If the semicolons are removed, the output operators WILL have left-hand operands, which will be an `ostream` object is each case from the result of the previous expressions.

```c++
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1
          << " and " << v2
          << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
```
