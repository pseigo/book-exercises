Explain the key differences between pointers and references.

## Solution

- Pointers are objects. References are not objects.
- Pointers can be reassigned to new values throughout their life. References are permanently bound to an object.
- References must be initalized. Pointers don't _have_ to be initialized, but accessing an uninitalized pointer is undefined and can cause runtime crashes.
