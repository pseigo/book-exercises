What does the following program do?

```c++
int i = 42;
int *p1 = &i;
*p1 = *p1 * *p1;
```

## Solution

- Line 1: initalize an integer `i` with a value `42`.
- Line 2: initialize a pointer `p1` with a value of `i`'s memory address.
- Line 3: deference `p1`, and use the assignment operator `=` to assign a value of `i * i`, which is equivalent to `42 * 42`.
